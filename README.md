PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Building a machine learning model to predict online payment Fraud
Steps used for this Project:
- I imported my data to juypter notebook
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
-I trained my models and used cross validation
- confusion matrix and classification report.


Challenges Faced:
- It was really hard encoding my categorical variables as my work was consuming memory
- Both models was okay for my prediction, precision and recall helped me decide whuch model is fit for my problem statement. 

Attached is my Juypter Notebook for more Analysis made on Online Payment Fraud Detection System.
